# Projects

## [Fantasy Football Quarterback Points Estimator](https://github.com/AskSid/Fantasy-Football-Regression)
* Predicts the total season fantasy football points for a quarterback based on their previous season data
* Data originally from profootballreference.com
* Used a neural network from the TensorFlow/Keras library trained with a regression output
* Outputs a ranking of the top 30 quarterbacks by fantasy football points
* Does slightly worse than some ESPN analysts when using a mean-squared error metric of accuracy

## [Fantasy Football Wide Receiver Points Classifier](https://github.com/AskSid/Fantasy-Football-Classification)
* Predicts the interval of a wide receiver's fantasy football points per game between 1 and 5
* 1 indicates less than 10 points per game, 2 indicates between 10 and 15 points per game, and so on until 5 which indicates more than 25 points per game
* Used a neural network from the TensorFlow/Keras library trained with a classification output
* Ranks receivers by categorizing them by interval based on their previous season performance
* Data originally from profootballreference.com

## [Housing Prices Estimator](https://github.com/AskSid/Housing-Prices-Regression)
* From kaggle.com competition Ames Housing dataset as training and testing data
* Used regression analysis with a random forest regressor and a gradient boosting regressor to determine which would result in a more accurate output
* Evaluated based on the root mean squared error between the log of the predicted value and log of the observed sales value
* Accuracy of 98.14% and 98.73% using square eror of random forest and gradient boosting regressor respectively

## [Pixelated Clothing Classifier](https://github.com/AskSid/Clothing-Classifier)
* Data from MNIST Fashion dataset of 25 by 25 pixelated grayscale images of clothing
* Used a convolutional neural network to classify images into 10 types of clothing by training the model
* The accuracy on the test set was 88.64% for classifying the images

## [BHS Schedule](https://github.com/AskSid/schedule_classes)
* Built for my personal use to determine what classes I have everyday for my school schedule
* Predicts what classes a student will have based on a 7-day waterfall schedule where the student has 6 classes a day
* Uses the datetime libraries to keep track of the date and day of the week
